# Gaspereau Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning Prior to Import Into DM Apps

### Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis
* [Notebook 1.1. Fish Details (data cleaning and EDA)](1.1%20Data%20Cleaning%20and%20EDA%20-%20Fish%20Details%20(updated).ipynb)
* [Notebook 5. Logbook / Samples (data cleaning)](5.%20Data%20Cleaning%20-%20Gaspereau%20Length%20Frequency.ipynb)
* [Notebook 6. Fish Length Frequencies (data cleaning)](6.%20Data%20Cleaning%20-%20Gaspereau%20Logbook%20Data%20(Samples).ipynb)
* [Notebook 7. Fish Details and Length Frequencies (EDA)](7.%20EDA%20length%20frequency%20and%20logbook.ipynb)
* Note: Notebook number that are not included are older calculations that have been replaced with more concise analysis. These calculations identify problems to be dealt with during the next phase, but the calculations are not required prior to import.

### Data Cleaning and Import Preparation
* [Notebook 10. Cleaning and Creating Tables for Import](10.%20Cleaning%20and%20Creating%20Tables.ipynb)
* Note: This is a standalone calculation notebook. Issues from the previous notebooks are addressed, but none of the previous calculations need to be run for this notebook to fully process and prepare the data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualisation
* [Notebook 11. EDA Prior to Import](11.%20EDA%20of%20final%20data%20prior%20to%20import.ipynb)
* [Notebook 12. EDA of Data Which Where Rejected During Import](12.%20EDA%20after%20import.ipynb)
* Note: These visualisation notebooks are not required for import. They are used to identify issues prior to or subsequent to import.

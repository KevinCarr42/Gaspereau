next steps:
* confirm that everything looks properly cleaned
* check HERMAN app and figure out what tables we need to import
* confirm app is working correctly, and what it would look like with gaspereau 
* convert the cleaned table into multiple tables as required
  * django? pandas?
* document everything in a simplified jupyter notebook
* import and see how it looks


NOTES:
dm_apps vs excel
* site doesn't include numbers consistent with HERMAN app
  * 78 unique sites
    * but some are multiple sites comma separated
    * mostly numeric, some names
* sample information? 
  * use changes in fish number (back to 1)
  * no field reference number/ID. auto generate? leave null?



MISSING DATA?
* type (port or sea) is required
* uuid is required 
* sampler_ref_number is required
* gear is required
* experimental_net_used is required

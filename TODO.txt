next steps:
* confirm that everything looks properly cleaned
* check HERMAN app and figure out what tables we need to import
* confirm app is working correctly, and what it would look like with gaspereau 
* convert the cleaned table into multiple tables as required
  * django? pandas?
* document everything in a simplified jupyter notebook
* import and see how it looks

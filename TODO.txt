next steps:
* confirm that everything looks properly cleaned
* check HERMAN app and figure out what tables we need to import
* confirm app is working correctly, and what it would look like with gaspereau 
* convert the cleaned table into multiple tables as required
  * django? pandas?
* document everything in a simplified jupyter notebook
* import and see how it looks


Cleaning Steps:
* import as correct filetypes where possible
  * object elsewhere
* backup str copy of AGE and FSP
* convert to numeric, coercing errors
  * FL_FROZEN, MATURITY, GONAD_WEIGHT, AGE, FSP, AGE.1, FSP.1
* clean PERIOD
  * 'PM ' => 'PM'
  * CONFIRM: 'AD' => 'AM'
    * there are 118 entries, 5 adjacent groups
* clean CONDITION
  * FRESH, FROZEN => Fresh, Frozen

* CONFIRM BEFORE FINAL CLEANING:
  * FL_STD
    * values < 100 (all 2019, 264 entries)
      * CONFIRM: null or 10x
        * ~correct distribution for 10x
  * FL_WET and FL_FROZEN
      * CONFIRM: null or scale (5 entries, both FL_WET and FL_FROZEN)
        * row 35058 (~100x smaller)
        * 35143 (~10x smaller)
        * 35157 (~100x smaller)
        * 35158 (~100x smaller)
        * 35186 (~100x smaller)
  * second AGE and FSP comments
    * what to do to those?
  * SEX
    * 'U' 
      * CONFIRM: leave as is
        * there are 749 'U' in 1987 (way more than all other years combined)
    * 'B'
      * CONFIRM: convert to na (only one instance)
        * ALT: could leave as is
  * MATURITY
    * CONFIRM: 44 => na (only one instance)
      * ALT: could assume it is a 4
